A simple Java program that sniffs the network and displays the DNIs and passwords that are exhibit in the plain text of a POST HTTP req.

This implementation uses the 'jpcap' lib, provided by SourceForce http://sourceforge.net/projects/jpcap/. 
Besides, 'jpcap' uses the 'libcap' library, that must be installed and well configured to work.

Why did I do this?
------------------

To show why it is so important to CHANGE PERIODICALLY your passwords in your accounts. There are many leaks and bugs in the secutiry systems, such as passing passwords as plain text, and you'll have a better result if you have some conciderations each both.
